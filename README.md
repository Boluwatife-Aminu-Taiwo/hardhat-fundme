# Deployment to testnet or mainnet
1. ### Setup environment variables
    You'll want to set your SEPOLIA_RPC_URL and PRIVATE_KEY as environment variables. You can add them to a .env file, similar to what you see in .env.example.

* PRIVATE_KEY: The private key of your account (like from [metamask](https://metamask.io/)). NOTE: FOR DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE A KEY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
  * You can learn how to [export it here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key).
* SEPOLIA_RPC_URL: This is url of the seplia testnet node you're working with. You can get setup with one for free from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981)

2. ### Get testnet ETH
    Head over to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) and get some tesnet ETH. You should see the ETH show up in your metamask.

3. ### Deploy

    ```shell
    yarn hardhat deploy --network sepolia
    ```

# Scripts
After deploy to a testnet or local net, you can run the scripts.
```shell
yarn hardhat run scripts/fund.js
```
Or
```shell
yarn hardhat run scripts/withdraw.js
```

# Formatting

```shell
yarn format
```
